            <li>2 eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cider vinegar</li>

    </p>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <h5>Step 1</h5>
            <li>Mix warm water and yeast packet from bread mix together in a bowl and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <h5>Step 2</h5>
            <li>Place bread flour mix in the bowl of a stand mixer and add eggs, vegetable oil, vinegar, and yeast mixture; mix using the stand mixer set to low speed until smooth. Turn speed to medium and beat until mixture thickens, about 15 seconds. Transfer dough to a greased bowl, cover bowl with a dish, and allow dough to rise in a warm place for 45 minutes.</li>
            <h5>Step 3</h5>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <h5>Step 4</h5>
            <li>Spread dough onto a piece of plastic wrap. Brush melted butter over dough and sprinkle white sugar and cinnamon over dough.</li>
            <h5>Step 5</h5>
            <li>Roll dough into a jelly roll-type loaf by lifting 1 end of the plastic wrap and forming dough into roll. Place roll into a glass baking dish. Cut 1/2- to 1-inch slits into the loaf. Pour cream over the loaf.</li>
            <h5>Step 6</h5>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until dough is cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes. Break rolls apart.</li>
            <h5>Step 7</h5>
            <li>Mix confectioners' sugar and milk together in a bowl until glaze is smooth; drizzle over warm rolls.</li>
        </ol>
